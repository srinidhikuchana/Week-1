#EV Energy Forecasting System

This project estimates the real-world energy consumption and driving range of an Electric Vehicle by analyzing key factors such as speed, weather, and road conditions.
## Features
- Utilizes a Multivariate Linear Regression model trained on the Kaggle EV Energy Consumption dataset.


- Incorporates comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights.


- Future Scope: Integration with a Generative AI chatbot for intelligent trip planning.
