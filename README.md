EV-Energy-Forecaster is a data driven project that predicts the real world energy consumption and range of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using a Multivariate Linear Regression model. The model is trained on the Kaggle EV Energy Consumption dataset and analyzes key factors such as speed, weather conditions and road type to estimate realistic performance.
